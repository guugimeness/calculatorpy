# calculatorpy

## Objective: develop a basic calculator using Python

### Development:

In this project, I had contact for the first time with the Tkinker library, which is the most popular GUI (Graphical User Interface) library in Python. I used windows, frames, buttons, labels, among other features. 
Additionally, it was necessary to integrate the mathematical logic with Tkinker's applications, in addition to trying to prevent possible errors of use.
